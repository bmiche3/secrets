# secrets

This website was created to test out security and sign on features. I've enabled the ability to use google sign on, as well as allow the user to create a username
and password. The credentials are securely stored in a database where they've been salted and hashed. The same database also contains the secret that they've contributed 
to the website. Each user is allowed to contribute 1 secret.
